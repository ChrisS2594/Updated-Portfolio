    <p>Again Welcome to my portfolio website. I created this to display my abillities in different areas. However this page is dedicated to who I am.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly I love puzzles as stated on my welcome page, however when I look at these lines of code I get lost for hours not realizing what time it is.</li>
        <li>Secondly I believe I am a fast learned so I try to pick up on these skills quickly but maintain practice of them.</li>
        <li>Third: I have a strong outgoing personality that allows me to interact with others in a freidnly happy manner</li>
        <li> Lastly I am dedicated, when I set my mind to something I complete it in the end and take my time</li>
    </ul>
      
 </div>
